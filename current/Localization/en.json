At least, this is what they tell me. But the truth is I can't remember. Warp has taken hold of my mind. War has ravaged what’s left of my body. With every battle, a part of me is replaced. With each implant, I become more ideal for this job. One who is not burdened with a past. \n\nBut I remember enough that the cycle is the only constant in this life. Wars always follow wars. Who I am? Only one thing. I am Forever.\"",
        "Hero_Pilot_Idy_Bio": "\"They say no good deed goes unpunished, and I'm living proof of this. I was maimed when I saved a man's life and for this they called me \"king\". I came back from war with a phantom limb for my trouble. We pilots have a code of honor - to us a job is a job and when we work we do not take sides, but you must know how the Devil comes to find you when you're down?  I had hit rock bottom, and in a shameful moment of weakness I let myself believe an illusion: my body restored, wealth, a crew. All this and more was promised to me, but I fear the choice I have made will cost me everything.\"",
        "Hero_Pilot_Kate_Bio": "\"Mayflower childhoods toughen you up: all the group athletics and route marches, endless classes, not forgetting the meditation to help it all sink in. I only really liked the history lessons, how we came to be here, and eventually the Walking Wars. I learned my great-grandma was a pilot, and that was it for me - where Linda Cano had gone, I would follow. Mom and Dad wanted me to go to the Academy, but I wanted more. I left them a note, and the merc crew I ran with taught me enough that I became a robot engineer. All the battle a girl could want, and we got paid too! Wild Ten wasn't what I was expecting though, it's way better. It's like being one of the transplanted species from Earth - some animals never cope with the change of environment, but little birds like the sparrows have come to thrive.\"",
        "Hero_Pilot_Leonard_Bio": "Leonard comes from a Mars colony called Novod which is claimed by Freecon. Leonard’s lineage includes a number of distinguished soldiers, and his family name appears in the annals of Freecon history on many occasions. Leonard was educated at the prestigious Active Minds Combat University, where he ranked high in his class. Afterwards, he served in Freecon’s voluntary ground combat unit, where he distinguished himself and earned several corporate military honors and merits. \n\nRecords indicate that Leonard’s location as a Freecon operative was in deep space as part of the corporation’s anti-pirate initiative. Freecon sustained significant losses during this conflict. Leonard was discharged shortly after the Battle of Norma 330. Freecon documentation does not specify if a commissioned officer’s discharge is voluntary or involuntary.",
        "Hero_Pilot_Marcus_Bio": "\"Y'know, I grew up on Mars under a dome, and that's a small world for a wee lad. But I come up happy from blue-collar minin' stock. Mayflower to the last. That's where I found my callin', singing with the family. There was somethin' pure about joinin' our voices together. I said, when I was grown, I'd be a singin' star! but y'know, no one believed me, and they still don't. But I always believed in myself. Even after my band mates ditched me on this ...questionable outpost - I know i'm still destined for greatness! But 'fer now I'm stuck, making a livin'ere as a robot jock. Aye, it keeps me fed with a bed, but i'm gonna be a star ...jus' don't know how is all.\"",
        "Hero_Pilot_Carmen_Bio": "When your dad is the CEO of Freecon you're held to certain expectations, and lets say having a sickly kid wasn't part of the old man's precious vision. I tried, I did my best in the family business, but I was never good enough for my father. I had book smarts, not the killer-capitalist mindset the future corporate crown princess I was supposed to be, so I walked out and I'm making my own life here in the Wild Ten, but I know the old man hates the idea. He should be proud: I'm a great pilot, and all his lectures on leadership and strategy sank in enough to make me a natural squad leader. I'm thriving here, this is my place and I'm not going back, period."

    "ST_C_Classes": {
        "Class_devbot_Siren": "A backline robot capable of firing on enemies from a distance and freezing them briefly. Despite weak armor and mediocre firepower, the robot provides excellent team support. It is vulnerable in close combat to flankers, so Pilots must have good battlefield awareness.",
        "Class_devbot_Harpy": "A sniper support robot. It has a lot of fuel, allowing it to both reach places normally inaccessible to robots and quickly escape close combat. The Harpy's guns are weak against shields but effective against unshielded targets.",
        "Class_devbot_Tyr": "A classic support robot. Its repair drone can repair even critically damaged allies. Tyr benefits from allies spotting targets for it, as its missiles require time to lock onto targets and do not work well against shielded enemies.",
        "Class_Assault_name": "Assault",
        "Class_devbot_Fury": "Good in firefights and to counter Tacticians. Its weapons allow it to take down enemy shields at long range quickly, but its low capacity for armor damage means it should avoid close combat.",
        "Class_Assault_descr": "Assaults are designed for frontal attacks and mid-range firefights.  They carry powerful weapons and can hold out in open confrontations for long periods. Their shields start regenerating faster than other classes, and their armor is strong enough to take a lot of damage.",
        "Class_devbot_Ravana": "With its ability to protect itself and its allies during an attack, this robot makes a great team bodyguard. Its weaponry could be better suited for direct combat, but its broad area of effect allows it to cover large areas from a distance. This can slow down enemy advances and give enemy tacticians an unpleasant surprise.",
        "Class_Defender_name": "Defender",
        "Class_Defender_descr": "Defenders are designed to hold team positions. They are structurally strong, but their shields are weak. However, their shields regenerate almost instantly. A Defender's abilities boost its survivability and that of nearby allies.",
        "Class_devbot_Typhon": "Designed for skirmishes with distant enemy forces. Its built-in ability allows it to temporarily disable the weapons of multiple opponents, and its weapon can hit several targets at once. Typhon is poorly protected, so it should fight at a distance from behind cover.",
        "Class_devbot_Fenrir": "Fenrir's best bet is to rush into a fight, trade armor, withdraw, and regenerate. This requires a skillful combination of abilities and tactical maneuvering. It fights best at close range but works at medium range, too.",
        "Class_Flanker_name": "Flanker",
        "Class_Flanker_descr": "Flankers are fast robots that work best as scouts or assassins. Their speed allows them to move quickly across the map, capture unguarded Warp Gates, or conduct hit-and-run attacks from the sidelines.",
        "Class_devbot_Phantom": "The use of this short-ranged flanker is based on its built-in abilities. This robot will not survive a stand-up fight. Still, a good pilot can rush into enemy lines, wreak havoc, fire off ammunition, and then teleport to safety to restore its shields before the enemy can properly react.",
        "Class_devbot_Griffin": "It does not have the best armor for a defender, but its abilities make it ideal for counteracting enemy tacticians. Griffin is a team player but can hold their own in one-on-one fights with lightly armored opponents who get too close.",
        "Class_devbot_Loki": "Loki's ability to use holographic projections makes it an excellent infiltrator and scout. Its armor is strong for its class, and its anti-shield firepower means it can easily take on flankers, though it should avoid encounters with heavier robots.",
        "Class_Mixed_name": "Mixed",
        "Class_devbot_Purifier": "This is a super-heavy assault robot. Its clumsiness makes it vulnerable to long-range opponents, but this is balanced by its powerful armor. It is ideal for team assaults in confined spaces.",
        "Class_Mixed_descr": "Mixed Class robots are assembled from modules of different classes. They combine all the advantages and disadvantages of their components. For a robot to get a certain class, all of its modules must belong to that same class.",
        "Class_Tactitian_name": "Tactician",
        "Class_Tactician_descr": "Tacticians are backline robots that are designed to weaken enemies and support allies with ranged fire, thus helping to control the battlefield. Their components are lighter than other classes, while their high speed and large fuel capacity allow them to occupy positions inaccessible to other robots.",
        "Class_devbot_Raven": "This robot boasts an excellent combination of speed and armor. Equipped with a beam weapon that requires precise aim, Raven may only deal little damage, but a skilled pilot can target the enemy's weak spots from a distance.",
        "Class_devbot_Varangian": "This robot is ideal for initiating combat and weakening enemy robots with area-of-effect damage. Due to the low speed of its missiles, it will struggle to hit fast enemies. It can seriously damage Defenders and Assaults, and its signature ability will allow it to survive retaliatory fire.",
        "Class_devbot_Scorpion": "The Scorpion is an assassin. The pilot must wait until the enemies are weak enough to be picked off individually. The robot's weapons are ideal for critical damage up close and heavy fire at long range.",
        "Class_devbot_Lancelot": "This defender is perfect for pilots who value durability. It is as big and cumbersome as it is tough, and it can regenerate when its allies take damage. Its poor mobility and low shield damage won't let it deal with enemy flankers, but large enemies will suffer under a hail of shells.",
        "Class_devbot_Bulwark": "This machine is easy to handle and does not rely on friendlies being nearby. It can evade enemy fire, and its weapon does not require reloading. This robot is strong in prolonged close-quarters battles but is vulnerable against long-range, rapid-fire foes.",
        "Class_devbot_Ares": "This flanker is designed for rapid, aggressive attacks against single targets. Despite its lightweight construction, it can inflict tremendous damage up close while protected by its shield. Abilities help Ares safely retreat when it becomes vulnerable due to long weapon reloads.",
        "Class_devbot_Orochi": "Use this lightweight robot to scout for enemies and spot artillery fire. It's fast and carries long-range lasers but is vulnerable in close combat. Its best tactic is constant movement and targeted strikes at the enemy's flanks.",
        "Class_devbot_Bulgasari": "A versatile robot for medium and close-range combat. Built-in abilities allow you to flush tacticians into the open. Because of its high mobility, it can effectively counter flankers, but due to its lack of firepower, it is better to avoid direct combat with heavier robots."
