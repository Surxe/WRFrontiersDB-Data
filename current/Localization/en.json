This being prior to the Workers Uprising, conditions on Tortuga were rough and overcrowded, and workplace safety at mining complexes such as Fissure on Wild Prime was almost non-existent. The mine he worked in suffered a partial collapse, and he was exposed to a great deal of raw Noachium dust.

Earning the name \"Bright\" because of her albinism, she stood out, but it wasn’t the only way she was different.  Even in FortEvo society, she demonstrated combat skills beyond those of the most augmented citizens. This made her dangerous. This also made her an outsider.\nIsolated and alone, she wandered until she found herself in a place for misfits like herself. Tortuga. She started as a hangar worker. GIANCARLO agreed to mentor her. On her first mission, she wowed everyone with her skills, but recognition wasn’t what wowed her back. It was The Wild Ten. The quiet of the new land was a comfort she had not known.

Within the pilot community, she's attempting a soft coup by constantly angling for squad leadership. This has put her on everyone's radar, not necessarily in a good way. The funny thing about needing to prove yourself is that it never ends. Once you rise in the ranks, the burden of proof also rises. Books is certain she'll meet the challenge, but his critics believe the expectations will outpace him. The Morgan Crime Family is watching \"Books\".

    "ST_C_Classes": {
        "Class_devbot_Siren": "A backline robot capable of firing on enemies from a distance and freezing them briefly. Despite weak armor and mediocre firepower, the robot provides excellent team support. It is vulnerable in close combat to flankers, so Pilots must have good battlefield awareness.",
        "Class_devbot_Harpy": "A sniper support robot. It has a lot of fuel, allowing it to both reach places normally inaccessible to robots and quickly escape close combat. The Harpy's guns are weak against shields but effective against unshielded targets.",
        "Class_devbot_Tyr": "A classic support robot. Its repair drone can repair even critically damaged allies. Tyr benefits from allies spotting targets for it, as its missiles require time to lock onto targets and do not work well against shielded enemies.",
        "Class_Assault_name": "Assault",
        "Class_devbot_Fury": "Good in firefights and to counter Tacticians. Its weapons allow it to take down enemy shields at long range quickly, but its low capacity for armor damage means it should avoid close combat.",
        "Class_Assault_descr": "Assaults are designed for frontal attacks and mid-range firefights.  They carry powerful weapons and can hold out in open confrontations for long periods. Their shields start regenerating faster than other classes, and their armor is strong enough to take a lot of damage.",
        "Class_devbot_Ravana": "With its ability to protect itself and its allies during an attack, this robot makes a great team bodyguard. Its weaponry could be better suited for direct combat, but its broad area of effect allows it to cover large areas from a distance. This can slow down enemy advances and give enemy tacticians an unpleasant surprise.",
        "Class_Defender_name": "Defender",
        "Class_Defender_descr": "Defenders are designed to hold team positions. They are structurally strong, but their shields are weak. However, their shields regenerate almost instantly. A Defender's abilities boost its survivability and that of nearby allies.",
        "Class_devbot_Typhon": "Designed for skirmishes with distant enemy forces. Its built-in ability allows it to temporarily disable the weapons of multiple opponents, and its weapon can hit several targets at once. Typhon is poorly protected, so it should fight at a distance from behind cover.",
        "Class_devbot_Fenrir": "Fenrir's best bet is to rush into a fight, trade armor, withdraw, and regenerate. This requires a skillful combination of abilities and tactical maneuvering. It fights best at close range but works at medium range, too.",
        "Class_Flanker_name": "Flanker",
        "Class_Flanker_descr": "Flankers are fast robots that work best as scouts or assassins. Their speed allows them to move quickly across the map, capture unguarded Warp Gates, or conduct hit-and-run attacks from the sidelines.",
        "Class_devbot_Phantom": "The use of this short-ranged flanker is based on its built-in abilities. This robot will not survive a stand-up fight. Still, a good pilot can rush into enemy lines, wreak havoc, fire off ammunition, and then teleport to safety to restore its shields before the enemy can properly react.",
        "Class_devbot_Griffin": "It does not have the best armor for a defender, but its abilities make it ideal for counteracting enemy tacticians. Griffin is a team player but can hold their own in one-on-one fights with lightly armored opponents who get too close.",
        "Class_devbot_Loki": "Loki's ability to use holographic projections makes it an excellent infiltrator and scout. Its armor is strong for its class, and its anti-shield firepower means it can easily take on flankers, though it should avoid encounters with heavier robots.",
        "Class_Mixed_name": "Mixed",
        "Class_devbot_Purifier": "This is a super-heavy assault robot. Its clumsiness makes it vulnerable to long-range opponents, but this is balanced by its powerful armor. It is ideal for team assaults in confined spaces.",
        "Class_Mixed_descr": "Mixed Class robots are assembled from modules of different classes. They combine all the advantages and disadvantages of their components. For a robot to get a certain class, all of its modules must belong to that same class.",
        "Class_Tactitian_name": "Tactician",
        "Class_Tactician_descr": "Tacticians are backline robots that are designed to weaken enemies and support allies with ranged fire, thus helping to control the battlefield. Their components are lighter than other classes, while their high speed and large fuel capacity allow them to occupy positions inaccessible to other robots.",
        "Class_devbot_Raven": "This robot boasts an excellent combination of speed and armor. Equipped with a beam weapon that requires precise aim, Raven may only deal little damage, but a skilled pilot can target the enemy's weak spots from a distance.",
        "Class_devbot_Varangian": "This robot is ideal for initiating combat and weakening enemy robots with area-of-effect damage. Due to the low speed of its missiles, it will struggle to hit fast enemies. It can seriously damage Defenders and Assaults, and its core gear will allow it to survive retaliatory fire.",
        "Class_devbot_Scorpion": "The Scorpion is an assassin. The pilot must wait until the enemies are weak enough to be picked off individually. The robot's weapons are ideal for critical damage up close and heavy fire at long range.",
        "Class_devbot_Lancelot": "This defender is perfect for pilots who value durability. It is as big and cumbersome as it is tough, and it can regenerate when its allies take damage. Its poor mobility and low shield damage won't let it deal with enemy flankers, but large enemies will suffer under a hail of shells.",
        "Class_devbot_Bulwark": "This machine is easy to handle and does not rely on friendlies being nearby. It can evade enemy fire, and its weapon does not require reloading. This robot is strong in prolonged close-quarters battles but is vulnerable against long-range, rapid-fire foes.",
        "Class_devbot_Ares": "This flanker is designed for rapid, aggressive attacks against single targets. Despite its lightweight construction, it can inflict tremendous damage up close while protected by its shield. Abilities help Ares safely retreat when it becomes vulnerable due to long weapon reloads.",
        "Class_devbot_Orochi": "Use this lightweight robot to scout for enemies and spot artillery fire. It's fast and carries long-range lasers but is vulnerable in close combat. Its best tactic is constant movement and targeted strikes at the enemy's flanks.",
        "Class_devbot_Bulgasari": "A versatile robot for medium and close-range combat. Built-in abilities allow you to flush tacticians into the open. Because of its high mobility, it can effectively counter flankers, but due to its lack of firepower, it is better to avoid direct combat with heavier robots."

Only seasoned Pilots can operate them, so consider this the next milestone in your career.\r\n\r\n– APPM-3TR, Combat Coordinator",
        "Tutorial_Level6_Workshop_Crafting_Description": "In the Wild Ten, even scrap has value. Salvage is a prized commodity, traded like credits and essential for pilots in the Workshop. Once you’ve collected enough, bring it to the nearest Workshop to craft new modules for your robots. Just a heads-up—you’ll need blueprints to get started. Acquiring them can be risky, but the rewards are worth it.\r\n\r\n– The Lace, Master Mechanic",
        "Tutorial_Level7_RobotRoles_Chimera1_Description": "On Tortuga, not every robot fits neatly into a class. Pilots often mix and match parts to create designs that suit their unique style. We call these hybrids Mixed-Class because they break away from standard battlefield roles. I’ve sent you all the parts you’ll need to build my favorite mixed robot called Griffin. Good luck, and remember—on the frontier, there are no rules.\r\n\r\n– The Lace, Master Mechanic",
        "Tutorial_Level7_RobotRoles_Flanker2_Description": "Across the Wild Ten, we rely on Warp Gates to transport people and materials to and from Tortuga.

With speed and agility, they’re perfect for capturing objectives. Take your Phantom out there and start claiming those Warp Gates. Your employer is counting on you.\r\n\r\n– APPM-3TR, Combat Coordinator",
        "Tutorial_Level7_Titan_UseAbilities_Description": "Titans have the power to change the outcome of any contract—every pilot knows this. But their strength isn’t just about size. It’s the Core gear that truly sets them apart. These machines are built for the toughest challenges, and their abilities are more than enough for any skilled pilot. But don’t just take my word for it, try it yourself.\r\n\r\n– The Lace, Master Mechanic",
        "Tutorial_Level8_Titan_UpgradeWeapon_Description": "Did you know Titans were first built for the Walking Wars 200 years ago? While this does limit the variety of weapons available, don’t let that discourage you. We can keep upgrading them. Gather some salvage, head to the Workshop, and see how ingenuity defines life on the Frontier.\r\n\r\n– The Lace, Master Mechanic",
        "Tutorial_Level9_Titan_UpgradeModule_Description": "As a mechanic, there’s nothing that brings me more joy than upgrading Titans. They’re beautiful machines. While they can be challenging to work on, each upgrade I complete help me to learn more about them. Maybe one day, I'll design and build one right here on Tortuga. I know, it’s just a dream for now, but I wanted to share it with you, my friend.\r\n\r\n– The Lace, Master Mechanic",
